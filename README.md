# Cordova Plugin Fingerprint All-In-One

This plugin is my attempt to provide a single interface for accessing fingerprint hardware on both Android 6+ and iOS.

There are some great cordova plugins out there that make use of the fingerprint APIs provided by Android and iOS. But I could not find a project which supports both platforms (correct me if I am wrong). So I decided to take the native code and bundle it together in one plugin.

## Work in Progress
Use with caution at the moment. Still under development..
